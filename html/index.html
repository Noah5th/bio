   <p class="text-center"> A person who has had an impact on my life is me. I have never been influenced by anybody but myself. I might receive help but I am not influenced by the things other people do. I like doing what I want to do and not caring about what other people do. I like wearing shorts year round and a hoodie as long as it’s not summer. My parents always say it’s too cold to wear shorts but I wear them. It can be miserable in 20 degrees’ weather wearing shorts. You will get used to it eventually. I don’t want the newest things that others might have I like what I have. New clothes might sound good to others, but it takes a while to get worn in sometimes. When people have the newest shoes, I think old shoes are better because they’re not stiff.</p> 

<p class="text-center"> I also have positive impact on my life by doing things the way I want them too. When others do things it might not work for you. I prefer lots of examples when I study because figuring how to work them out myself doesn’t work. Not having people who have a can also be good. You don’t want to be like that person too much. Parents might help you but you don’t know what works for you. You have to figure out things yourself sometimes.</p> 

<p class="text-center"> I don’t see a person who could influence me. School is really hard and I don’t think there is anybody influential that could help with school. School takes a huge part of my life and it suck’s. I dread going to most of my classes. I give myself advice like just go through the the da and it will end eventually. Some times it seems like it will drag on forever. My influential quote would have to be “Teachers don’t think about the students; they just do what benefits them.” If teachers would consider my influential quote school might be easier. Sometimes they pile on the work way too much and we can’t get it done. If they would take the time we could do better in school.</p> 

<p class="text-center"> A lot of people probably feel overwhelmed when it comes to school. All the work is super overwhelming and I always have a lot of homework on the weekends. Homework on the weekends was not made to be a thing. Weekends are time off of school, but they aren’t most of the time.     
 Overall I am my only influence. Nobody has had a huge impact on my life but me. Doing things my own way makes things easier. Half the times the things people do never seem to work. Doing things your way is the way to go.</p>
